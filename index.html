        <div class="ans"> 
            <h3>People have attempted to predict the weather for centuries. The Babylonians used cloud formations and astrology to forecast conditions
                 in 650 BCE. Aristotle's Meteorologica, written about 350 BCE, identified weather patterns. Theophrastus also compiled the Book of Signs, 
                 a book on weather forecasts. Weather prediction lore in China dates back to at least 300 BCE, around the same period as ancient Indian 
                 astronomy developed weather-prediction methods. Observed cycles of events, also known as pattern recognition, is used in ancient weather 
                 forecasting methods. It has been noted, for example, that if the sunset was especially red, the next day was usually sunny. This knowledge was 
                 passed down over the years, resulting in weather lore. However, not all of these forecasts are accurate, and many of them have been proved to be 
                 unreliable after being subjected to stringent statistical research.</h3>

                         company budgets are decided. inaccurate forecasting can have serious impacts on the rest of the organization,
                          The time of medium range forecast is usually 1 year.</h3>
